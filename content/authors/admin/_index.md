I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Sociology at Virginia Tech, focusing my research on social stratification, economic inequality, and social demography.

The current issues driving my research include (1) examining why certain governments, despite possessing strong state capacity, overlook the deepening of income inequality; (2) investigating the instability in middle-class support for egalitarian social policies; and (3) analyzing the Age, Period, and Cohort Characteristics of Married Childless Families in Taiwan.
